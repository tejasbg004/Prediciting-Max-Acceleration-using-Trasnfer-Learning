# Predicting Max acceleration using the Concept of Trasnfer Learning

## Transfer learning
### The Idea is that Force-Displacement curve obtained in Quasi-Static testing can be representative of the impact testing. Hence, this work slightly extends the work of gongora et.al to predict the maximum acceratio by using RNN as the means to reduce the dimension of the F-D curve.
