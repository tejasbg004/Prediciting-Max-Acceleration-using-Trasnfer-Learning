# Predicting Max acceleration using the Concept of Transfer Learning

## Transfer learning
### The Idea is that Force-Displacement curve obtained in Quasi-Static testing can be representative of the impact testing. Hence, this work slightly extends the work of gongora et.al to predict the maximum acceratio by using RNN as the means to reduce the dimension of the F-D curve.

## Main.ipynb
### This Notebook consist of main code used to perform various task such as data preprocessing, Matching necessary Id's from two different tests, Dimensionality reduction, Prediction, Cross validation.

## Weights
### Contains weights of the GRU-Autoencoder

## Data
### Consist of all necessary data from Quasi-Static Testing and Impact testing  and also F-D curve from Quasi-Static testing.
